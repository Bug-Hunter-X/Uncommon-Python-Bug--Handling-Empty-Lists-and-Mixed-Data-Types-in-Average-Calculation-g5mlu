This repository contains examples of uncommon Python bugs. The example demonstrates how to handle empty lists and lists with mixed data types in an average calculation function. The bug is in the `calculate_average` function. The function does not handle empty lists or lists containing non-numeric values. The solution adds error handling to check for these conditions and return an appropriate result.
